AuToast!

Just a little javascript learning project for myself to practice asynchronous functions and manipulating the DOM.

Untappd is a wonderful app. As a craft beer lover, it has enabled me to meet like-minded drinkers across Singapore and the world.
One of my favourite features is toasting, because who doesn't like spreading the cheer? Personally, I made it a goal to toast every single check-in from my friends.

Unfortunately, since starting university, I've had many social and academic commitments that have put my love for craft beer on the back seat. Thus, I've decided to write some code to automate the tedious process of toasting (especially on weekends when everyone is drinking a ton of beer!).

If you'd like to add me on untappd, you can find me at https://untappd.com/user/himari. Cheers!

To use this tool, log in to Untappd, navigate to the homepage, then simply run the code within autoast.js in your browser console.
